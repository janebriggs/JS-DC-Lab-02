# Create a Project Plan

What steps can we piece out to get us through from start to finish?
1. simple server using express
    a.  console.log and make sure express is running
2. build out models, schemas, and database
    a.  models folder
        i. build new Schema to include artist name, image url, description, and comments
    b. database
        i. use mongoose uri to connect
3. views
4. controller (router)
    a.  require and use each of our routes (artists page and index page)

What are a couple of goal posts we can work towards, based on what entities and features we need to build out?
1.  Making sure that each of the routes works
2.  Building out a homepage
3.  Building a page for creating a new artist
4.  Building a page for displaying an artist

Which features should we build first and why?
