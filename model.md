# Domain Modeling

We need to spend some time thinking about what data our application will use and how it will use it.

What entities will our application have?
-artist pages (model)


What properties will that entity or those entities have?
-artist pages need a title, image, description, and comments

How will we need to work with our entity? (create new ones? edit them? delete them?)
-Users will submit a form and create an artist page
-Users will edit artist pages

The best practice is to think about each entity or object that your application will rely on and what properties those entities will have.

# Create a Project Plan

Now that we know what entities we will need to build out in our application, we need to get started! But, rather than just jump into the console and start coding, lets plan out what we'll need to build.

What steps can we piece out to get us through from start to finish?
1. simple server using express
2. build out models, schemas, and database
3. views
4. controller (router)

What are a couple of goal posts we can work towards, based on what entities and features we need to build out?

Which features should we build first and why?
